## 1. Introduction

This repository is showcasing my journey and solutions through a series of hands-on Python challenges. These challenges are designed to highlight my ability to apply fundamental and advanced Python concepts. Developed as interactive notebooks in Google Colab, they provide a clear and hands-on look at my practical skills, covering everything from core data types and control flow to functions and debugging. This project demonstrates my proficiency in using Python to solve real-world problems.

## 2. Features

- Demonstrated Python Skills: Clearly shows my understanding and practical use of core Python concepts.
- Structured Learning Path: Reflects the step-by-step approach I took to build my Python foundation.
- Interactive Notebooks: All exercises and explanations are provided in interactive Google Colab notebooks for easy review.
- Comprehensive Topic Coverage: Covers key Python essentials: data types, lists, sets, tuples, conditionals, loops, functions, and debugging.
- Practical Debugging Skills: Includes specific exercises that highlight my ability to find and fix errors in code.
- Cloud-Based Environment: Easily accessible and runnable directly in your browser with Google Colab.

## 3. Getting Started

To access and review these Python notebooks, you only need a Google account and internet access.

### 3.1. Prerequisites

- A Google Account (for Google Colab)
- Internet access

### 3.2. Installation

All project content is directly accessible via Google Colab links. No local Python environment setup is strictly required to review the notebooks, but you can clone this repository to keep a local copy of the links and README.

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/Cebulva/python_practicing.git

# Navigate into the cloned repository directory
cd python_practicing
```

### 4. Reviewing the Notebooks

To review these Python practice notebooks, simply click on the provided Google Colab links below. Each link will open a notebook directly in your browser. You can then examine the code cells, their output, and the explanations to understand my work and learning process.

### 5. Python Topics & My Notebooks

This section outlines the fundamental Python concepts I covered in this collection of Google Colab notebooks, demonstrating my understanding of each. Click on each title to expand and access the notebook.

<details>
<summary>Numbers and Strings</summary>
<br>
This notebook demonstrates my understanding of basic Python elements: comments, variables, and fundamental data types including numbers (integers, floats) and strings (with f-string formatting), along with Booleans.

<details>
<summary>Lists and Dictionaries</summary>
<br>
Here, I showcase my work with core Python collections: lists (creation, access, updates, removals, and two-dimensional lists), dictionaries (creation, access, updates, removals), and an introduction to tuples and sets.
